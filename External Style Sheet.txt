External Style Sheet

The CSS styles are defined in a separate ".css" file and export 
.css file  and import into another component file.
--> we can link (connect) .css file to component file.
--> Advantage:

it supports re usabiltiy . that means
the css file can create only once reuse same styles to 
multiple web components.


ex:
-----
in generally in react CSS code write in APP.CSS file .

--> export App.css file and import into App.js
in our coponent file.
